# Overlay Touch Fix for iOS

## Problem Description

When using `betterPlayerController.setControlsEnabled(false)` on iOS, overlay widgets placed on top of the video player could not receive touch events, while on Android they worked correctly.

Additionally, when controls were enabled, touching the overlay would also trigger player controls (pause/play), which was not the desired behavior.

## Root Cause

The issue was in two places:

1. **AbsorbPointer widget**: Used in both Material and Cupertino controls with the logic:

```dart
AbsorbPointer(
  absorbing: controlsNotVisible, // Always true when controls are disabled
  child: Stack(...)
)
```

2. **GestureDetector**: The main GestureDetector in controls was always handling touch events regardless of whether controls were enabled or disabled.

When `setControlsEnabled(false)` was called:

1. Controls UI elements (topBar, bottomBar, hitArea) would return `SizedBox()` (not visible)
2. However, `AbsorbPointer` would still absorb touch events with `absorbing: controlsNotVisible`
3. `GestureDetector` would still handle touch events and trigger player controls
4. On Android, `AbsorbPointer` behavior was more permissive
5. On iOS, `AbsorbPointer` completely blocked touch events from reaching the overlay

## Solution

Modified both the `AbsorbPointer` logic and `GestureDetector` behavior to only handle touch events when controls are enabled.

### Material Controls Fix

```dart
// Before
AbsorbPointer(
  absorbing: controlsNotVisible,
  child: Stack(...)
)

// After
AbsorbPointer(
  absorbing: controlsNotVisible && betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled,
  child: Stack(...)
)

// Before
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () { /* always handles touch */ },
  onDoubleTap: () { /* always handles touch */ },
  onLongPress: () { /* always handles touch */ },
)

// After
GestureDetector(
  onTap: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
  onDoubleTap: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
  onLongPress: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
)
```

### Cupertino Controls Fix

```dart
// Before
AbsorbPointer(
  absorbing: controlsNotVisible,
  child: isFullScreen ? SafeArea(child: controlsColumn) : controlsColumn
)

// After
AbsorbPointer(
  absorbing: controlsNotVisible && betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled,
  child: isFullScreen ? SafeArea(child: controlsColumn) : controlsColumn
)

// Before
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () { /* always handles touch */ },
  onDoubleTap: () { /* always handles touch */ },
  onLongPress: () { /* always handles touch */ },
)

// After
GestureDetector(
  onTap: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
  onDoubleTap: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
  onLongPress: betterPlayerController!.controlsEnabled ? () { /* only when enabled */ } : null,
)
```

## Behavior After Fix

- **When controls are disabled (`setControlsEnabled(false)`)**:

  - Overlay can receive touch events on both iOS and Android
  - Player controls (pause/play) are not triggered when touching overlay
  - Controls UI is completely hidden

- **When controls are enabled and visible**:

  - Normal behavior, overlay can receive touch events
  - Player controls work normally

- **When controls are enabled but hidden**:
  - Controls absorb touch events, overlay cannot receive them
  - Player controls can be triggered by tapping

## Testing

Use the "Overlay touch test" example in the demo app to verify the fix:

1. Launch the overlay touch test page
2. Tap the red overlay button to verify it works
3. Click "Disable controls"
4. Try tapping the overlay again - it should work on both Android and iOS without triggering player controls
5. Click "Enable controls" to restore normal behavior
